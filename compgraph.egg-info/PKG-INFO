Compute Graph
---
In this project you can find authors implementations of four compute graph solving different tasks.
In general compute graph is a sequence of map, reduce, join and sort operations, which help us to 
solve complex tasks.

Here you can find solutions for:
1. Word counter
2. Inverted TF-IDF index calculation
3. Top words based on Pointwise mutual information metric
4. Average speed depending on weekday and hour

Getting Started
---
#### Installing

To install this libraty you simply need to clone this repository and run this command from your terminal:
`pip install compgraph`

#### Running Scripts
To run our algorithms, we have command line interfaces. They are located in `/examples` folder. You can simply run them from your terminal:

` python3 examples/run_inverted_index.py <input_file> <output_file>`

`python3 examples/run_word_count.py <input_file> <output_file>`

`python3 examples/run_yandex_maps.py <input_time_file> <input_length_file> <output_file>`

`python3 examples/run_pmi.py <input_file> <output_file>`


Running the tests
---
In our library we have tests that cover over than 97% of code. In order to run them you need to run this command from your terminal:
`pytest compgraph`

All the tests for library are in the `/tests` directory.
